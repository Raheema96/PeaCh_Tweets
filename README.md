Many companies create accounts on social media platforms to bring awareness to their brands and promote their products and services. PeaCh, a natural skincare company, has decided to increase its online presence, starting with X, previously known as twitter. Since they started their operation in 2021, they have focused most of their online advetisements to instagram which mainly reaches a particular segment of customers availabe in their region, Kuwait. Deciding to broaden their customer base to reach and attract more customers, I have been hired to perform a sentiment analysis to see how other companies are perceived on this platform. I'll be using the twitter dataset provided by them. This dataset includes the list of companies, the sentiments(irrelevant, neutral, positive and negative) and the tweet relating to them. They want me to find soloutions to the following issues specified by them:

Find users interested in natural skincare products
Suggests ways to use X to generate more sales to their website
Increase international customer base
By analysing the data provided by them, I'll be using classification models to help find possible solutions to the stated problems.
